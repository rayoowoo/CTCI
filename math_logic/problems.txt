6.1 The Heavy Pill
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? 
You can only use the scale once. 

A:
Assuming we know the measurements of the bottles (or that they are all the same), we can load the
bottles on one at a time, until we load a bottle on that increases the weight by more than expected.
That should be the heavy bottle.

6.2 Basketball
You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
    Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
    Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

A: 
Basically, we have to calculate the probability of missing 0 or 1 balls. That's fairly simple: (1-p) per ball, 
so p(1-p)2 for missing 1 ball and (1-p)3 for missing all the balls. Then, we need to find when that is greater
than p. When we plot the resultant equation, 1 - 3p + p2, on a graph, we find that y is greater than 0 when 
p is less than 0.382. Therefore, if p < 0.382, we should take the three shots.

6.3 Dominos
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos,
and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove 
your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

A:
No there is no way to covering all the squares, because two individual squares will be separated from each other 
no matter how you arrange the dominos.

But I donâ€™t know how to prove this.

6.4 Ants on a Triangle
There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or
all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction,
with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.

Similarly, find the probability of collision of n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

A:
There's 50% chance for each ant to go one way. So for all of them to go to the right, that's 0.125 (1/2 ** 3). 
For all of them to go to the left, it's also 0.125. So the likelihood is 0.25. 25% chance they don't meet. Therefore 75%
chance two of them do meet.

in binary:
000 - ants dont' meet. 
001
010
100
011
101
110
111 - ants don't meet. 

The general rule is 1 - 2 * (0.5n), where n is the number of ants.

6.5 Jugs of Water
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you 
come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" 
of the jug would be impossible.

A:
Fill up the three quart jug. Pour that into the five quart jug. Then fill the three quart jug again. This time, only pour until the five quart jug is full. That should leave only one quart of water in the three quart jug.
