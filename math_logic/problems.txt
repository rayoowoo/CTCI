6.1 The Heavy Pill
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? 
You can only use the scale once. 

A:
Assuming we know the measurements of the bottles (or that they are all the same), we can load the
bottles on one at a time, until we load a bottle on that increases the weight by more than expected.
That should be the heavy bottle.

Solution:
if we take 1 pill from bottle 1, and 2 from bottle 2, then the decimal amount over 210grams / 0.1 grams would
give the bottle #.

6.2 Basketball
You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
    Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
    Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

A: 
Basically, we have to calculate the probability of missing 0 or 1 balls. That's fairly simple: (1-p) per ball, 
so p(1-p)2 for missing 1 ball and (1-p)3 for missing all the balls. Then, we need to find when that is greater
than p. When we plot the resultant equation, 1 - 3p + p2, on a graph, we find that y is greater than 0 when 
p is less than 0.382. Therefore, if p < 0.382, we should take the three shots.

6.3 Dominos
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos,
and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove 
your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

A:
No there is no way to covering all the squares, because two individual squares will be separated from each other 
no matter how you arrange the dominos.

But I donâ€™t know how to prove this.

6.4 Ants on a Triangle
There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or
all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction,
with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.

Similarly, find the probability of collision of n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

A:
There's 50% chance for each ant to go one way. So for all of them to go to the right, that's 0.125 (1/2 ** 3). 
For all of them to go to the left, it's also 0.125. So the likelihood is 0.25. 25% chance they don't meet. Therefore 75%
chance two of them do meet.

in binary:
000 - ants dont' meet. 
001
010
100
011
101
110
111 - ants don't meet. 

The general rule is 1 - 2 * (0.5n), where n is the number of ants.

6.5 Jugs of Water
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you 
come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" 
of the jug would be impossible.

A:
Fill up the three quart jug. Pour that into the five quart jug. Then fill the three quart jug again.
This time, only pour until the five quart jug is full. That should leave only one quart of water in the three quart jug.

6.6 Blue-Eyed Island
A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the
island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color,
but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue
eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

A:
If there's only one person with blue eyes, it will take them one day, given that in a day, he or she can look at everyone
else's eyes. If there is more than one person with blue eyes, I don't think they'll ever leave without knowing how many
people on the island have blue eyes.

6.7 The Apocalypse
In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees 
that all families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide by this
policy - that is, they have to continue to have children until they have one girl, at which point they immediately stop -
what will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume the odds of someone having a boy or a girl on any given
pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.  


The answer is 50%. If you have 50% girls and 50% boys in one birth, then 50% of that 50% will be girls in the second birth,
along with 50% boys. And that cycle keeps repeating and repeating. Therefore, you will end up with 50% girls and 50% boys. 

function apocalypse(n) {
    let boys = 0;
    let girls = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let j = Infinity;
        while (j >= 0.5) {
            j = Math.random();
            if (j >= 0.5) boys++;
            if (j < 0.5) girls++;
        }
    }
    return boys/girls;
}

A:
The simulation is to pick a number at random from 0 to 1. if the number is less than 0.5, increment a boy. Otherwise, 
increment a girl. Do this until you get a girl. The number of total cycles this happens represents how many families 
there are. The higher the number, generally, the closer the two are proportionately.

6.8 The Egg Drop Problem
There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from
any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

A:
You drop on even floors. If it breaks, drop on the floor underneath. The one underneath is N. 

Solution: 
The solution involves considering load balancing. Of course, if we wanted to minimize the number of drops on the first egg,
we could start with floor 50, and then perhaps 75. And then on the second egg, go up one by one. Or, we could minimize th
number of drops on the second egg, which means going up two at a time for the first egg, and then dropping the second egg
only once. The real minimum number of drops overall would be when the number of drops on both eggs is equal. We would need
to take the approach that for every subsequent drop on the first egg, we would decrease the number of floors we go up. So
if we start at floor 10, we would go to floor 19, then 28, etc. So what floor should we start on? 

If we do the math, it's floor 14.

6.9 100 Lockers
There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker.
Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens if it is closed). This process
continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass I, the man toggles every ith locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway,
in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

A:
One observation I can make is that after 50, the man is only toggling one locker every pass: the ith locker. 
All prime numbered lockers will be closed, because they are opened once for the first pass, and then closed for pass i. 
The first locker will definitely be open. 
If the number is a square of a number, it will be open. (1, sqrt, itself). 
If the number is a product of two primes, it will be closed. (1, pr 1, pr 2, itself).

There should be 10 lockers open, because only perfect square number lockers are left open.  This is because any number that
has an even number of factors will be closed: this is most numbers, including primes.
