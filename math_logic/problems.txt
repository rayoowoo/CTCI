6.1 The Heavy Pill
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? 
You can only use the scale once. 

A:
Assuming we know the measurements of the bottles (or that they are all the same), we can load the
bottles on one at a time, until we load a bottle on that increases the weight by more than expected.
That should be the heavy bottle.

6.2 Basketball
You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
    Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
    Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other ?

A: 
Basically, we have to calculate the probability of missing 0 or 1 balls. That's fairly simple: (1-p) per ball, 
so p(1-p)2 for missing 1 ball and (1-p)3 for missing all the balls. Then, we need to find when that is greater
than p. When we plot the resultant equation, 1 - 3p + p2, on a graph, we find that y is greater than 0 when 
p is less than 0.382. Therefore, if p < 0.382, we should take the three shots.

6.3 Dominos
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos,
and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove 
your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

A:
No there is no way to covering all the squares, because two individual squares will be separated from each other 
no matter how you arrange the dominos.

But I donâ€™t know how to prove this.
